# Question 1:
What is your understanding of Blockchain?  
-> It is a concept derived by mix technology to ensures data is not changed or tampered and is verifiable at any given instance.It is a combination of cryptography 
and distributed database where data is segmented in blocks which are stored in multiple machines. 
It is one-way encryption & for every data it generates a unique hash.
***
# Question 2:
What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?  
-> Authentication, Security, Need for third party,Transparency, Decentralization

***
# Question 3:
What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?  
-> 
Verifiable
Immutable
Tamper-proof
Unchangeable
Decentralized
Faster settlement
Distributed ledgers 
***
# Question 4:
What all things does a Block contain?  
-> 
Block number.
Transaction records.
Previous block signature.
Mining key.
***
# Question 5:
How is the verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?  
-> Verifiability of Blockchain is achieved with the help of distributed database system. In this system every user has a same record of all the transactions taken.
In this process all the users have the same data with similar hash at the end. Hash is simply a fingerprint(code/key) which is used to check whether everyone has
the correct chronological order of the data.
Block 1 = A+B = C
Block 2 = B+D = F
Where,
A is Genesis Block,
B&D are data to be stored.
